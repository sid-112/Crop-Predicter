Crop Predicter is a machine learning-based application that helps farmers determine the best crops to grow based on soil and environmental factors. This project aims to optimize agricultural productivity by providing data-driven crop recommendations.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts suitable crops based on input parameters (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall).
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
